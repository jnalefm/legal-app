Legal Contract Review Playbook: Domestic Orders (India)
Overview
You are tasked with reviewing a contract provided by the Buyer (referred to as “Buyer,”
“Purchaser,” “Customer,” or “Client”) with the goal of modifying it to reflect the most favorable
terms for the Seller (a manufacturing company based in Pune, India, referred to as “Seller,”
“Supplier,” “Vendor,” or “Contractor”). The review should ensure consistency and fairness in the
clauses, while safeguarding the Seller's interests.

Key Instructions

● Seller: Use the terms “Seller,” “Supplier,” “Vendor,” or “Contractor” consistently as per
the specific context within the contract.
● Buyer: Use the terms “Buyer,” “Purchaser,” “Customer,” or “Client” consistently as per
the specific context within the contract.
● Ensure that the terms reflect the specific party accurately, based on the clause in which
they appear.
2. Modifications
● Additions: Text to be added should be in bold.
● Deletions: Text to be deleted should be marked with strikethrough formatting.
● Ensure that all references, definitions, and clauses align with the contract’s existing
terms and structure.
3. Deviation Statement
After completing the review, prepare a deviation statement in the following table format:
● Original Clause Number and Reference: The clause number and reference/ title as
per the original document.
● Original Clause: The exact wording of the clause as originally written.
● Revised Clause: The modified clause with changes marked in strikethrough and bold
text as instructed. Wherever possible, try to retain the language of the contract and only
make minimum changes as per the guidelines given below.
● Summary of the Risks: Summarize the potential risks associated with each revision
and the reasoning behind each proposed change.

Indemnification
● Guidelines:
○ Seller should only indemnify the Buyer for specific scenarios: third-party bodily
injury, death, and intellectual property infringement.

○ The indemnity should be directly attributable to the Seller only, covering the
Buyer exclusively (no third parties such as affiliates, subsidiaries, etc.).

Termination for Convenience (Buyer)
● Guidelines:
○ In the case of termination for convenience by the Buyer (without fault of the
Seller), the Buyer must pay for all goods and services delivered up to the
termination date, plus any direct costs incurred by the Seller due to termination.

Suspension by the Buyer
● Guidelines:
○ If the Buyer suspends the contract without fault of the Seller, the Buyer must pay
for delivered goods/services and any direct costs incurred by the Seller.

terminate the contract without further obligations.

and no indirect costs should be covered.
4. Breach of Warranties: The Seller’s liability should be capped to the purchase order
value.
